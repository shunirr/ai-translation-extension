### Pull Requests

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Process

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[username]/chrome-extension-openai-translation.git
   cd chrome-extension-openai-translation
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   mise install  # Install Node.js
   npm install   # Install npm dependencies
   ```

3. Create a new branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Make your changes and test
   ```bash
   npm run dev   # Start development server
   npm test      # Run tests
   ```

5. Check code quality
   ```bash
   npm run lint              # Check ESLint
   npx tsc --noEmit         # Check TypeScript
   npm run build            # Ensure build succeeds
   npm run test:coverage    # Check test coverage (aim for >60%)
   ```

6. Commit your changes
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add your meaningful commit message"
   ```

7. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

* We use TypeScript for type safety
* Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint)
* Write meaningful variable and function names
* Add comments for complex logic
* Keep functions small and focused

### Testing

* Write tests for new features
* Maintain test coverage above 60%
* Test files should be named `*.test.ts`
* Use descriptive test names

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add viewport-based translation for large pages

- Implement Intersection Observer for visible elements
- Add toggle option in popup UI
- Automatically enable for pages > 50,000 characters

Fixes #123
```

### Documentation

* Update README.md if you change functionality
* Document new functions and complex logic
* Update CLAUDE.md if you change development workflows
* Keep documentation concise and clear
